Given an array arr[] of integers and another integer target. Determine if there exist two distinct indices such that the sum of their elements is equal to the target.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [0, -1, 2, -3, 1], target = -2
Output: true
Explanation: arr[3] + arr[4] = -3 + 1 = -2
Input: arr[] = [1, -2, 1, 0, 5], target = 0
Output: false
Explanation: None of the pair makes a sum of 0
Input: arr[] = [11], target = 11
Output: false
Explanation: No pair is possible as only one element is present in arr[]

Constraints:
1 ‚â§ arr.size ‚â§ 105
-105 ‚â§ arr[i] ‚â§ 105
-2*105 ‚â§ target ‚â§ 2*105

        Determines if any two distinct elements in the array sum up to the given target.

        ‚úÖ Approach:
        - Traverse the array once.
        - For each element, compute the difference between target and the current value.
        - Use a set to store previously seen values for O(1) lookups.
        - If the required value is already in the set, a valid pair exists.

        ‚è±Ô∏è Time: O(N), where N is the length of the array
        üß† Space: O(N), due to the extra set used for lookups
