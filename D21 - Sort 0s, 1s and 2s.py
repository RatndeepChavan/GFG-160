Given an array arr[] containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s. Sort the array in ascending order.

You need to solve this problem without utilizing the built-in sort function.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]
Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]
Explanation: 0s 1s and 2s are segregated into ascending order.
Input: arr[] = [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]
Explanation: 0s 1s and 2s are segregated into ascending order.

Follow up: Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant extra space?
Constraints:
1 <= arr.size() <= 106
0 <= arr[i] <= 2
