You are given an integer array arr[]. Your task is to find the smallest positive number missing from the array.

Note: Positive number starts from 1. The array can have negative integers too.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, -3, 4, 1, 1, 7]
Output: 3
Explanation: Smallest positive missing number is 3.
Input: arr[] = [5, 3, 2, 5, 1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Smallest positive missing number is 4.
Input: arr[] = [-8, 0, -1, -4, -3]
Output: 1
Explanation: Smallest positive missing number is 1.

Constraints:
1 <= arr.size() <= 105
-106 <= arr[i] <= 106

        Finds the smallest positive integer missing from the array.

        This uses index marking (in-place hashing):
        - Ignores negatives and zeros
        - Marks presence of numbers in [1, n] range by flipping the sign at their index
        - The first index with a positive number indicates the missing number

        Args:
            arr (List[int]): The input array.

        Returns:
            int: The smallest missing positive integer.

        Space Complexity: O(1)
