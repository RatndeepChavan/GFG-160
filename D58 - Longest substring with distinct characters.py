Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring with all distinct characters.

Examples:

Input: s = "geeksforgeeks"
Output: 7
Explanation: "eksforg" is the longest substring with all distinct characters.
Input: s = "aaa"
Output: 1
Explanation: "a" is the longest substring with all distinct characters.
Input: s = "abcdefabcbb"
Output: 6
Explanation: The longest substring with all distinct characters is "abcdef", which has a length of 6.

Constraints:
1<= s.size()<=3*104
All the characters are in lowercase

        ✅ Approach:
        - Use a sliding window with two pointers `left` and `right`.
        - Maintain a hash map to store the last seen index of each character.
        - If a repeating character is found within the current window, shift the left pointer just after the last occurrence.
        - Continuously track and update the maximum length.

        ⏱️ Time: O(N), where N is the length of the string
        🧠 Space: O(1), at most 26 entries in the map
